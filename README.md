## AWS Lambda TypeScript Starter

This repository serves as a template for creating AWS Lambda functions using TypeScript and deploying them with the Serverless framework. It provides a basic structure to get you started quickly.

# Structure

The repository follows the following structure:

`code`
.
├── src/
│ └── index.ts

├── out/

├── .gitignore

├── .prettierrc

├── package.json

└── README.md

src/: This directory contains the source code for your AWS Lambda function.

index.ts: The main file where the Lambda handler function is defined. You can implement your desired functionality within this file.
out/: This directory is meant to store the converted files or any output generated by the build process. You can customize this folder as per your requirements.

.gitignore: Specifies the files and directories that should be ignored by Git.

.prettierrc: Configuration file for Prettier, a code formatter that helps maintain consistent code style.

package.json: The npm package file that lists the dependencies and scripts required for your project.

serverless.yml: The Serverless Framework configuration file. It defines the AWS resources, such as the Lambda function and API Gateway, and their associated settings.

## Getting Started

To start using this template, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone <repository_url>
Install dependencies: npm install
Implement your desired functionality within the index.ts file.
Build the TypeScript code: npm run build
Deploy the Lambda function using Serverless: npx serverless deploy

## Functionality

The provided index.ts file contains a basic Lambda handler function that responds with a "Hello World!" message. You can modify this function to implement your desired logic.

The function is triggered by an API Gateway event and returns an HTTP response with a status code of 200. The response body is a JSON string containing the "Hello World!" message. You can customize these values as needed.

Feel free to explore the AWS Lambda and Serverless Framework documentation for more information on advanced usage and configuration options.
